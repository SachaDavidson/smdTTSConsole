# smdTTSConsole
My very first text-to-speech console application based on Microsoft's quick start documentation

Here is a link to the documentation referenced in the creation of this project: 
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/get-started-text-to-speech?tabs=windows%2Cterminal&pivots=programming-language-csharp

This is my very first project using Microsoft Azure's Speech AI services 

## Get Started

- To use this application you will need to have Visual Studio installed (I used Visual Studio 2022 Community)
- You will also need to have an Azure Speech Service configured in your own Azure subscription
- Add your key and preferred region in the appsettings.json file, under "SpeechKey" and "SpeechRegion", respectively
- Run the application and provide a text sample into the console once you are prompted to do so, then press enter
- You should hear the text you provided synthesized into speech, through your default audio device
- If you wish to provide additional samples, press the "y" key, then press enter
- Once you are finished, exit the application by closing the program OR by pressing any key other than the "y" key, then pressing enter
